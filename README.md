# Data Engineering Portfolio (*In Progress*)

## Overview

This portfolio showcases my data engineering projects, demonstrating my ability to design, build, and optimize data pipelines for batch and real-time processing. The goal is to leverage modern data tools and platforms to implement scalable, efficient solutions for data storage, processing, and analytics.

## Key Areas of Focus

### 1. Database Design & Data Modeling
   - Design and optimization of relational and NoSQL databases.
   - Implementation of normalized schema, star and snowflake schemas, and data partitioning strategies for efficient querying and storage.
   - Focus on ETL pipelines, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

### 2. Batch Processing
   - Development of batch data pipelines using technologies like Apache Spark, AWS Glue, and Azure Data Factory.
   - Efficient scheduling and execution of batch jobs with a focus on scalability and performance.

### 3. Real-time Data Streaming
   - Implementation of real-time data pipelines using tools like Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, and Azure Stream Analytics.
   - Focus on data ingestion, processing, and delivery with low-latency systems to support live analytics and monitoring.

### 4. Data Analytics & Visualization
   - Use of AWS services (Athena, Redshift) and Azure Synapse Analytics for running complex queries, aggregating large datasets, and performing ad-hoc analytics.
   - Creation of dashboards and reports to visualize insights.

### 5. Containerization with Docker
   - Containerization of data pipelines and services using Docker to ensure portability, scalability, and easy deployment across environments.
